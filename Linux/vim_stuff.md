### This page exists because I suck @ VIm, I will do things and then put them in here, k?

#### Tidy up some not so nice looking code be adding a newline after every specified character:
`:%s /*/^M/g` - this regex will find each asterisk (*) and then replace with carriage return (^M) - we get that with CTRL+v and enter - i don't think g is actually needed also...

#### general usage
Start selecting lines: `shift+V` characters is just lower v
To copy: `y` to cut: `d`
