[These](https://github.com/kymb0/post_exploitation/blob/master/Linux/helpful%20one%20liners.md) one liners will help throughout.

### start:  
`nmap -sV -sC 10.10.10.242 >> nmap.txt`  

#### 80/443?  
browse to pages, always capture in burp  
Always copy unique comments on CMS's and page source into notes and KEEP reffering back to them when stuck.  

#### wordpress  
for wordpress boxes dont fuck around with the garbage HTB submissions with wordpress on them, just use `unix/webapp/wp_admin_shell_upload`

#### For medium + boxes
If you are struggling for a foothold, try subdomains and/or dirs/files with either a small wordlist or cewl one as seen on `tenet`:  
`cewl http://<site>/ > cewl.txt`  
Use intruder as below with cewl list as payload (easier to manage responses and tested params AND it removes need for trying wildcards linked to the IP)  
```
GET /§§.php HTTP/1.1  
Host: §ss§.tenet.htb  
<REST OF REQ>  
```
If still struggling try running doscovered endpoints through burpPRO discover content/active scan etc. This helped me find the .bak file on tenet (although I should have figured that out from the clue in comments)

### After foothold:

#### windows?
`bring in winpeas and [powerup](https://github.com/kymb0/post_exploitation/blob/master/Windows/powersploit.md)`

#### Local sql
If able to login to sql locally after getting foothold, go [here](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/sql-injection/mysql-sql-injection-cheat-sheet) for commands, if you are in /nologin/ shell you may not see output until after you `exit;`  
Once you have hashes [use john](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/john-the-ripper-hash-formats)  
*remember to dump hashes from the relevant DB* eg `mysql --user=drupaladmin --password="lubbawubbadubdub" -D drupal -e 'select name,pass from users;'
`
