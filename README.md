### Any hacker worth their salt can Google faster than someone should be able to ask questions

### Best traits you can have:
```
Googling fast and identifying accurate info among the noise and bullshit

Think of different things to try when you don't actually know

Be aware that what you're doing can be dicey and so trying things in a safe way
```

**Your goals though are to establish yourself quietly.**

**You need to know if you're in a busy area or a quiet place.**

_Check what's installed on the box, is it up to date? Is there shadow software? Does it look like it gets looked after?
Do I have internet access? Then do very gentle, small enumeration of the subnet around. See if anything is there. Does anything respond to ICMP pings?
You can't trust that there isn't any AV or EPP in place. Carbon Black agents hide from you. You won't find it.
Your biggest things to worry about escalating to DA is that you don't know how this domain uses its DA accounts. You could be creating a log entry of a DA accessing and being active on a box that they haven't touched in 3 years. You're leaving a trail of event logs. They may not use DA accounts around the network in that manner. They could have extremely strict monitoring rules in place for DAs or they could have nothing. You don't know.
DAs are the holy grail to new testers. They are a double edged sword to the experienced._
